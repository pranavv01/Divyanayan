# Divyanayan

Divyanayan is an Android app designed to assist users by capturing images using the camera, extracting text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and reading the extracted text aloud. The app supports multiple languages and allows toggling between two OCR engines: Google ML Kit and Tesseract OCR. It also integrates Google Sign-In and Firebase Authentication for user login.

## Research & Development

- Conducted deep research on OCR engines including Google ML Kit and Tesseract OCR.
- Created a diverse multi-language dataset with various challenging parameters such as blurry images, dim lighting, and other real-world conditions.
- Performed extensive accuracy testing and comparative analysis of both OCR engines on this dataset.
- Integrated both OCR engines into the app based on research findings to provide flexible and accurate text recognition.
- This research forms the foundation of Divyanayanâ€™s OCR capabilities.
